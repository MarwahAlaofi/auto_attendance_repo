# Troubleshooting
The script is built and primarily tested on **Mac OS**. Some successful testing has been done on **Windows 10** as well.
<br>The code is built based on some assumptions which may not hold true in all cases and many issues are likely to arise while using the script. Below I will add some common issues and how to address them:     
1. [Element not found error] âž” increase the waiting time to ensure a completely downloaded DOM (slow internet connection leads to slow DOM download) <br>
